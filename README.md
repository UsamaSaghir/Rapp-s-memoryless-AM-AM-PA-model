The following project is an implementation of Rapp power amplifier model to study its output and evalute the adjucent channel leakge ratio (ACLR).
Following are the major stages of the project.
* Generation of a 16-QAM signal having symbol rate of 40 MHz, 8-times oversampling, and excess bandwidth of 25%.
* Implementation of  Rappâ€™s memoryless AM-AM PA model and inputing the 16-QAM signal through a nonlinear power amplifier model, using back-off values
 of 10 dB, 5 dB, and 0 dB from the 1-dB compression point of the PA.
* Evaluation of the ACLR of the output signal in each backoff point. The channel width is 40 MHz, and the spacing between the centers of the desired and
adjacent signal bands is assumed to be 50 MHz.
